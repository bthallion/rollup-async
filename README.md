# rollup-async

> Async function demo for Ben Hallion.

## Why?

 - Rollup produces the best output (simplest necessary, no bloat).
 - Rollup is fast!
 - Rollup has treated me very well whereas I've had issues with other build tools.

## Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sholladay/rollup-async.git &&
cd rollup-async &&
npm install
```

## Usage

To see the demo, simply do: `npm run demo`. Rollup will compile modules with `async` functions and they will be run in the browser via a test page, which will open in your default browser.

The point here is to show that Rollup does not care whether the code uses `async` functions or not. And Rollup itself does not demand that you use Babel, though obviously [browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=async-functions) is a constraint.
